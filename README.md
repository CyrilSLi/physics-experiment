# physics-experiment

A project using HTML canvas to display different measurements of a drawn path.

## Update

To make this project accessible to people testing on the web, I have disabled acceleration calculations since they require a micro:bit's accelerometer.

## Usage

1. Draw a path using the mouse.
2. Click "Export" if you like to copy the path as a CSV string.
3. Click "Visualize" to see the measurements of speed, velocity, distance, and displacement.
